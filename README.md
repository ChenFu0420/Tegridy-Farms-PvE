# Tegridy-Farms-PvE-Menu

This is not a standalone menu, you need battleyent to use this. You can get the fixed battleyent.exe from my github (fixes current BE issues in less words.)

An expanded version of battleyent_helper, added gui, toggles, as well as an entire refactor.

This version is EXPERIMENTAL, this version includes revertable toggles, imgui menu, refactor for modularity, and the advapi32/unityplayer/iat hook patch.

It should be as simple as dropping the battleyent_helper.dll into the battleyent folder and running battleyent.exe as admin.

Insert - open menu

End - Safely exit game

More features will be added this week.

Build guide will be typed up shortly as of now I'm busy finishing things up. It's honestly very simple.. just add d3d11.lib dependency and imgui dependencies (included with source)

Good luck have fun
