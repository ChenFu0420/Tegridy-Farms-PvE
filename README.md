# Tegridy-Farms-PvE
An expanded version of battleyent, adding imgui toggles as well as an entire refactor.

This is meant as a source build, it will continue to be expanded on and updated. Features will be added this week.
Build guide will be typed up shortly as of now I'm busy finishing things up.

This version is EXPERIMENTAL, this version includes revertable toggles, imgui menu, refactor for modularity, and the advapi32 patch.
It should be as simple as dropping the battleyent_helper.dll into the battleyent folder and running battleyent.exe as admin.

Insert to open menu
End to force close game (to skip telemetry being send on game close.)

Good luck and happy farming! 🌾🚜
